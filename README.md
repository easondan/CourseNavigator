# Course Tree Generator

For this sprint, our team completed many tech debts to round out our application and get it ready for the final demo.

## Tech Debts

 - Added a filtering by credits option in the API Frontend.
 - Added a search bar to the course selector table in the API Frontend to allow the user to search by course code or keyword.
 - When a course is selected in the API Frontend, the user must now enter the grade they achieved in the course.
 - Improved the logic of the getPossibleCourses API to now consider total credits completed and cumulative average.
 - Created a downloadable HTML report in the API Frontend, containing information on the courses the user has completed and the courses they can take in the future.
 - Improved the speed of our getCourses API and fixed minor bugs.
 - Improved the structure and speed of our gitlab CI/CD pipeline.
 - Updated the test cases ran by the pipeline to reflect our new changes.
 - Added new API Frontend features, including credit and cumulative average trackers.
 - Improved the layout of the API Tree page.
 - Added a button in every page to allow the user to navigate back to the home page.
 - Added a loading icon while the tables populate, and a custom tab icon (currently was using default icon).
